    <p class="paragraph_1">
        British Solar Renewables wants to develop about 50 hectares (120 acres) of land north west of Belchamp St Paul, near Braintree.
        The company is in discussions with Braintree District Council about the farm, which would have a capacity of 50MW.
    <strong>
        The site would have a lifespan of 40 years before reverting to arable use.
