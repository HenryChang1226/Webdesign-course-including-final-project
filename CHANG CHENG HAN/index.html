            <h3>User Story</h3>

            <p> Hello, my name is Jonny and I am going to tell you my story. </p>

            <p>I was born on a quiet street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, my parents were workers and they had a small restaurant on Lafayette Avenue. Since those years I have been a lover of the smells and flavors of good food.
            </p>

            <p>When I finished school I decided to study gastronomy to work in a restaurant, but talking to a great chef, he insisted that I should have my own business.</p>

            <p>At that moment I decided that my goal would be to have my own restaurant, but the problem was that I had no money. At a family dinner on Christmas Eve, an aunt heard me talk about my project and told me that she had a small place in the center of Manhattan and that she could offer it to me at a very low rental price. I immediately thought that this was a great opportunity and that it would change my life forever.</p>

            <p>Over the next few months I worked really hard to get the place ready, painting the walls myself, designing the menu as best I could, and even giving the old chairs and tables from my parents' business a vintage look. The project grew day by day and every time I felt more prepared to open its doors. I was having a drink with a friend one night and she told me that every great restaurant should have a grand opening. That motivated me even more and I decided to do a big opening event.</p>

            <p>That night everything was ready, people were beginning to arrive, including some quite famous actors. The night seemed perfect. However, suddenly something happened, the power went out in the whole place and I thought that everything was collapsing. I panicked and became very upset, but I soon remembered that one night when I was little, the power in my house had also gone out and my parents decided that we should have dinner by candlelight. I immediately went to buy a lot of candles and we put them on all the tables. That little detail made the whole night a real success. People were happy for the food and for the intimacy of the situation.
            </p>

            <p>Currently I have branches of my restaurant in several of the big cities of the world and, since that night, all my restaurants are only lit by the beautiful flames of the candles.</p>
